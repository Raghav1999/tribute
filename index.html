            <h2 class="">Personal Life and Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                Srinivasa Ramanujan was one of India's greatest mathematical geniuses. Though he had almost no formal
                training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions
                to the analytical theory of numbers and worked on elliptic functions, continued fractions, and infinite
                series, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.
                Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 into a
                Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode, Mysore Kingdom (now Tamil Nadu, India), at the residence of his
                maternal grandparents. His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar, originally from Thanjavur
                district, worked as a clerk in a sari shop. His mother, Komalatammal, was a housewife and
                sang at a local temple.

                When he was nearly five years old, Ramanujan entered the primary school in Kumbakonam although he would
                attend several different primary schools before entering the Town High School in Kumbakonam in January
                1898. At the Town High School, Ramanujan was to do well in all his school subjects and showed himself an
                able all round scholar. In 1900 he began to work on his own on mathematics summing geometric and
                arithmetic series.
                Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902 and he went on to find his own method to solve
                the quartic.

                A child prodigy by age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were
                lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book written by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry.
                He mastered this by the age of 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he
                received merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he
                assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1,200 students (each with differing needs) to its
                approximately 35 teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and
                showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series.

                In 1903, when he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from
                a friend a library copy of A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, G. S.
                Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems. Ramanujan reportedly studied the contents of the book
                in detail. The book is generally acknowledged as a key element in awakening his genius. The next
                year, Ramanujan independently developed and investigated the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the
                Euler–Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal places. His peers at the time said they "rarely
                understood him" and "stood in respectful awe" of him.

                Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. Seeking mathematicians who
                could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal correspondence with the English
                mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognising Ramanujan's work as
                extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that
                Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "defeated me completely; I had
                never seen anything in the least like them before", and some recently proven but highly advanced
                results.
            </p>
            <p>
                During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and
                equations). Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the
                Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened
                entire new areas of work and inspired a vast amount of further research. The Ramanujan Journal, a
                scientific journal, was established to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by
                Ramanujan, and his notebooks—containing summaries of his published and unpublished results—have been
                analysed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new mathematical ideas.

                As late as 2012,
                researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings about "simple properties" and
                "similar outputs" for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle number theory results that
                remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death. He became one of the youngest
                Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to be elected a
                Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Of his original letters, Hardy stated that a single look was
                enough to show they could have been written only by a mathematician of the highest calibre, comparing
                Ramanujan to mathematical geniuses such as Euler and Jacobi.
